# FaceNet Implementation : BNK48 Members' Facial Recognition

#### A Facial Recognition model based on FaceNet

  

***For starter 
-- run ```initializer.py``` to locate and embed face from training datasets\
-- run ```classifier_train.py``` to train face classifier***



***For image recognition using : ```image_recog.py```\
For video recognition using : ```video_recog.py```***
